# tlars

**Title**: The Terminated-LARS (tlars) algorithm for high-dimensional early terminated forward variable selection

**Description**: It computes the solution path of the Terminated-LARS (tlars) algorithm. The tlars algorithm is a major building block of the Terminating-Knockoff (T-Knock) Filter. The T-Knock filter paper is available at https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.06048 (see also the R package 'jasinmachkour/tknock').

## Installation

You can install the tlars package with:

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jasinmachkour/tlars")
```
